## Project Overview

In this project, you will dive into the world of building Python scripts to interact with APIs, manage data, and organize it into various data structures. The project is designed to showcase the limitations of using Bash scripting for certain tasks and introduce you to the concept of APIs and their significance in modern software development.

## Key Concepts:

-   AirBnB clone
-   Web Framework
-   Routing
-   Templates
-   Variables
-   Whitespace Control
